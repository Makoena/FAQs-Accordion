.proud-of-this-javascript - .


 const accordionBtns =document.querySelectorAll('.accordion-btn')
accordionBtns.forEach(btn => {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
        this.classList.toggle('active')
        const accordionDescription = this.nextElementSibling
        const plusIcon = this.querySelector('.plus-icon')
        const minusIcon = this.querySelector('.minus-icon')

if(accordionDescription.style.maxHeight){
            accordionDescription.style.maxHeight=null
            plusIcon.style.display='block'
            minusIcon.style.display ='none'
        }
        else {
            accordionDescription.style.maxHeight= accordionDescription.scrollHeight +
            'px'
            plusIcon.style.display='none'
            minusIcon.style.block
        }
    })
})
